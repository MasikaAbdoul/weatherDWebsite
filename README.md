## Weather Dynamic Website 

It is a web application that allows users to get up-to-date weather information for any city in the world by entering the city name. 

The website uses the https://api.weatherapi.com/v1 API to fetch the weather information for the city entered by the user.

The homepage of the website features a search bar where the user can enter the name of the city they want to get weather information for. When the user enters the city name and clicks the 'Enter' button, the website sends a request to the Weather API to fetch the weather data for the specified city.

The website then displays the weather information for the city in a user-friendly format. The weather information displayed may include the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, visibility, and other relevant weather data. The website may also display additional information such as the sunrise and sunset times, the weather forecast for the next few days, and any severe weather alerts for the area.
